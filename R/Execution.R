# Note: Using S3 for consistency with settings objects in PLP, CohortMethod, and
# FeatureExtraction. If we want to use S4 or R6 we need to first adapt those
# packages. This will be difficult, since these settings objects are used throughout
# these packages, and are for example used in do.call() calls. We should also
# carefully consider serialization and deserialization to JSON, which currently
# uses custom functionality in ParallelLogger to maintain object attributes.
