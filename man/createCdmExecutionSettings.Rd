\arguments{
\item{workDatabaseSchema}{A database schema where intermediate data can be stored. The user (as identified in the
connection details) will need to have write access to this database schema.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The database schema containing the data in CDM format. The user (as identified in the
connection details) will need to have read access to this database schema.}

\item{cohortTableNames}{An object identifying the various cohort table names that will be created in the
\code{workDatabaseSchema}. This object can be created using the
\code{\link[CohortGenerator:getCohortTableNames]{CohortGenerator::getCohortTableNames()}} function.}

\item{tempEmulationSchema}{Some database platforms like Oracle and Impala do not truly support temp tables. To emulate temp tables, provide a schema with write privileges where temp tables can be created.}

\item{workFolder}{A folder in the local file system where intermediate results can be written.}

\item{resultsFolder}{A folder in the local file system where the module output will be written.}

\item{logFileName}{Logging information from Strategus and all modules will be located in this file. Individual modules will continue to have their own module-specific logs. By default this will be written to the root of the \code{resultsFolder}}

\item{minCellCount}{The minimum number of subjects contributing to a count before it can be included
in results.}

\item{integerAsNumeric}{Logical: should 32-bit integers be converted to numeric (double) values? If FALSE 32-bit integers will be represented using R's native \code{Integer} class. Default is TRUE}

\item{integer64AsNumeric}{Logical: should 64-bit integers be converted to numeric (double) values? If FALSE 64-bit integers will be represented using \code{bit64::integer64}.  Default is TRUE}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{ExecutionSettings}.
