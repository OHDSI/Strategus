\arguments{
\item{connectionDetailsReference}{A string that can be used to retrieve database connection details from a secure local
store.}

\item{workDatabaseSchema}{A database schema where intermediate data can be stored. The user (as identified in the

\code{\link[CohortGenerator:getCohortTableNames]{CohortGenerator::getCohortTableNames()}} function.}

\item{workFolder}{A folder in the local file system where intermediate results can be written.}

\item{resultsFolder}{A folder in the local file system where the module output will be written.}

\item{minCellCount}{The minimum number of subjects contributing to a count before it can be included
