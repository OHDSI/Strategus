(read the description)}
\usage{
syncLockFile(sourceOfTruthLockFileName, targetLockFileName)
}
\arguments{
\item{sourceOfTruthLockFileName}{The renv.lock file to use as the source of
truth}

\item{targetLockFileName}{The target renv.lock file that will be synced with
the source of truth}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the different packages and their version that
were involved in the synchronization process
}
\description{
Used to synchronize the values from the "source of truth" renv.lock file to
the target renv.lock file. Packages are compared (by name) and if the version
of the package in the "source of truth" is greater the one found in the
target, the target renv.lock file will be updated. This function will
automatically update the target file.

Version comparison is handled by the \code{semver} package and since most packages
use semantic versioning. When a package does not use semantic versioning,
a warning is provided so the user can review.
