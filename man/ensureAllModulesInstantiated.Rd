\title{Ensure all modules are instantiated}
\usage{
ensureAllModulesInstantiated(analysisSpecifications, forceVerification = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysisSpecifications}{An object of type \code{AnalysisSpecifications} as created
by \code{\link[=createEmptyAnalysisSpecificiations]{createEmptyAnalysisSpecificiations()}}.}

\item{forceVerification}{When set to TRUE, the verification process is forced
to re-evaluate if a module is properly installed. The default is FALSE
since if a module is successfully validated, the module will contain
the hash value of the module's renv.lock file in the file system so it can
by-pass running this check every time.}
}
\value{
A list containing the install status of all modules
(TRUE if all are installed properly) and a tibble listing
the instantiated modules.
}
\description{
Ensure that all modules referenced in the analysis specifications are instantiated
locally in the folder specified in the \code{INSTANTIATED_MODULES_FOLDER} environmental
variable.

Missing modules will be fetched from remote repositories.

This function will also check whether there are different versions of the same
module specified, which is not allowed, and whether all modules required by the
specified modules are also instantiated.
