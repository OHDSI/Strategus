\arguments{
\item{analysisSpecifications}{An object of type \code{AnalysisSpecifications} as created
by \code{\link[=createEmptyAnalysisSpecificiations]{createEmptyAnalysisSpecificiations()}}.}

\item{executionSettings}{An object of type \code{ExecutionSettings} as created

Sys.getenv("STRATEGUS_KEYRING_PASSWORD")}

\item{workers}{Optional: Number of local worker nodes to create for parallel execution
see https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html}
