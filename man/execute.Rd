\usage{
execute(
  analysisSpecifications,
  executionSettings,
  executionScriptFolder = NULL,
  connectionDetails,
  restart = FALSE,
  enforceModuleDependencies = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysisSpecifications}{An object of type \code{AnalysisSpecifications} as created
by \code{\link[=createEmptyAnalysisSpecificiations]{createEmptyAnalysisSpecificiations()}}.}

\item{executionSettings}{An object of type \code{ExecutionSettings} as created
by \code{\link[=createCdmExecutionSettings]{createCdmExecutionSettings()}} or \code{\link[=createResultsExecutionSettings]{createResultsExecutionSettings()}}.}

\item{executionScriptFolder}{Optional: the path to use for storing the execution script.
when NULL, this function will use a temporary
file location to create the script to execute.}

\item{restart}{Restart run? Requires \code{executionScriptFolder} to be specified, and be
the same as the \code{executionScriptFolder} used in the run to restart.}

\item{enforceModuleDependencies}{When set to TRUE, Strategus will enforce
module dependencies that are declared by each module. For example, the
CohortDiagnostics module declares a dependency on the CohortGenerator module
and Strategus will require that an analysis specification declare that both
modules must exist in order to execute the analysis. When set to FALSE,
Strategus will not enforce these module dependencies which assumes you have
properly run all module dependencies yourself. Setting this to FALSE is not
recommended since it is potentially unsafe.}
}
\value{
Does not return anything. Is called for the side-effect of executing the specified
analyses.
