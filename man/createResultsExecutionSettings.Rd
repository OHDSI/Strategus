\item{minCellCount}{The minimum number of subjects contributing to a count before it can be included
in results.}

\item{maxCores}{The maximum number of processing cores to use for execution. The default is to
use all available cores on the machine.}

\item{modulesToExecute}{(Optional) A vector with the list of modules to execute. When an empty vector/NULL is supplied (default),
