inspired by targets::tar_script but allowing custom variable execution}

\item{code}{code block to execute}

\item{moduleFolder}{Instantiated Strategus module folder}

\item{injectVars}{list of var names list(name=value) to replace (e.g. replace list(foo = "some string") will
find the pattern foo and replace it with the string some string - be careful!}

NULL invisibly

\description{
Designed to allow more human readable code that is executed inside a module as well as simple variable substituion
for injecting constants (e.g. simple parameters or file paths used inside and outside of modules)
}
\details{
This pattern also allows dependency injection which could be used if you don't want to use and renv and (instead)
would like to use docker images or just execution in the base environment for testing/debugging
}
